                    <p>Welcome to Version 2 of Project-Hub; the brand-new and improved version of the first version, which you can visit here: <a href="https://unbl0ck.github.io" target="_blank">https://unbl0ck.github.io</a>! Much effort was put into making this site the best one-stop-shop for any unblocked game content. Not only that, but we have made cloaking your activity much safer with About:Blank Cloaking, and new presets for masking your tab to make it appear like an appropriate site. There are also many ways where the community can pitch in their own ideas for the site. One of the many ways include clicking the contact button in the bottom-right, but you can also submit an issue on the GitHub repo, or email me at: <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?view=cm&fs=1&to=project.hub.games@gmail.com&tf=1" target="_blank">project.hub.games@gmail.com</a>.</p>
